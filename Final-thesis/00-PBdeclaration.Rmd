# Declaration {-}

I hereby declare that this thesis contains no material which has been accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma at any university or equivalent institution and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this thesis contains no material previously published or written by another person, except where due reference is made in the text of the thesis. 

This thesis includes 2 original papers published in peer reviewed journals and 2 submitted publications. The core theme of the thesis is anomaly detection in streaming time series data. The ideas, development and writing up of all the papers (with the exception of Chapter 5) in the thesis were the principal responsibility of myself, the student, working within the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, Monash University, under the supervision of Professor Rob J. Hyndman and Professor Kate Smith-Miles.
	
The inclusion of co-authors reflects the fact that the work came from active collaboration between researchers and acknowledges input into team-based research. 

In the case of Chapter 2-5 my contribution to the work involved the following:
